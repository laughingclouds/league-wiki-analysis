                A topic distribution represents what percentage of the article/document is related 
                to a particular topic. A text can be related to multiple topics, and this provides 
                an estimate of how much a text is related to that topic.

                A word cloud is a visual representation of a collection of words or terms where the 
                size of each word indicates its frequency or importance within the collection. 
                Frequencies for each word is generated, where stopwords are removed and only viable 
                words are kept.

            <p class="absolute left-3 ml-2 hidden max-w-sm rounded-lg p-3 pt-2 shadow-xl shadow-black group-hover:block">
                Along with regular words, n-grams are also formed to keep track of frequencies of 
                "Multiple Words" that occur together frequently. An example of n-gram could be a 
                person's name such as Elon Musk. These n-grams can be used frequently within a text 
                and it is important to keep a count of these as well. Together, a frequency 
                distribution is generated which helps in forming the word cloud

                    League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility,
                    character designs, and production value. League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is
                    a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Its success has spawned several spin-off video games, including League of Legends: Wild Rift, a
                    mobile version, Legends of Runeterra, a digital collectible card game and Ruined King: A League of
                    Legends Story, a turn-based role-playing game, among others. Since its release in October 2009,
                    League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to
                    develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. In 2019, League regularly peaked at eight million
                    concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music, comic books, short stories,
                    and the animated series Arcane. League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game
                    in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an
                    isometric perspective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    League of Legends is the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene consisting
                    of multiple regional leagues; they culminate in an annual League of Legends World Championship.
                    However, negative and abusive in-game player behavior, criticized since the game's early days,
                    persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. Each of the ten players controls a character,
                    known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play.
